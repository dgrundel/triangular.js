# tripod.js
Two-way databinding is sooo 2009.

http://dgrundel.github.io/tripod.js/

## What's that you say? Three-way data binding?

Data seamlessly synced between your JavaScript, the DOM, and LocalStorage.

## Oh yeah, that means it syncs across browser tabs.

Whaaaaat!? I know, right?

## Even works on Grandpa's browser.

Tripod.js works in IE7+. Of course, the real browsers are supported, too.

## Dependencies? Nope.

## Tripod.js is a library, not a framework.

So stop complaining, already. It doesn't tell you how to write your Javascript or design your systems. It's just a handy place to store your data and helps keep it organized and displayed nicely.

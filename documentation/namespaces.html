<p>Hey, where did <code>vehicle</code> come from in the last example? 
	Oh right, I told you we were going to talk about namespaces. Now you know.</p>

<p>The elaborate formula for your data attributes is: <code>[namespace.]attribute</code>. The namespace part is optional but recommended.</p>

<p>How about some examples?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- namespace: person, attribute: name --&gt;
&lt;input data-bound-to="person.name"&gt;

&lt;!-- no namepsace, attribute: name --&gt;
&lt;input data-bound-to="name"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Make sense?</p>

<p>Namespaces are used not only in your binding attributes,
	but are also used when saving to LocalStorage, so it's a
	good idea to use them if you're planning on persisting 
	your data to LocalStorage.</p>

<blockquote>Tripod uses the same <code>namespace.attribute</code> convention as the key for LocalStorage.</blockquote>

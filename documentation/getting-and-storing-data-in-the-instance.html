title: Getting and Storing Data in the Instance
---

<p>The aforementioned getter and setter are creatively named <code>get()</code> and <code>set()</code>.</p>

<h3><code>instance.get()</code></h3>

<p>Remember the example <code>firstCar</code> instance we created above? What was the color again? I can't remember.</p>

<pre><code>var theColor = firstCar.get('color');
console.log(theColor); // "Rust"</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>instance.get()</code> will throw an error if you attempt to access an attribute that doesn't exist.</p>

<h3><code>instance.set()</code></h3>

<p>Oh, darn. We forgot to add the year. No worries.</p>

<pre><code>firstCar.set('year', 1980); // Sweet. This baby is practically brand new.</code></pre>

<p>Note that we can set an attribute that didn't already exist, just like a normal JS object.</p>

<h3>But, wait a minute, my data is in the DOM!</h3>

<p>Hang on, we're getting there. I'll give you a hint. You're looking for <code>instance.load()</code>.</p>

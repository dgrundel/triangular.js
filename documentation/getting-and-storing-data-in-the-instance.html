title: Getting and Storing Data in the Instance
---

<p>The aforementioned getter and setter are creatively named <code>get()</code> and <code>set()</code>.</p>

<h3><code>get()</code></h3>

<p>Remember the example <code>firstCar</code> instance we created above? What was the color again? I can't remember.</p>

<pre><code class="js">var theColor = firstCar.get('color');
console.log(theColor); // "Rust"</code></pre>

<p>Note that <code>get()</code> will throw an error if you attempt to access an attribute that doesn't exist.</p>

<h3><code>set()</code></h3>

<p>Oh, darn. We forgot to add the year. No worries.</p>

<pre><code class="js">firstCar.set('year', 1980); // Sweet. This baby is practically brand new.</code></pre>

<p>Note that we can set an attribute that didn't already exist, just like a normal JS object.</p>

<blockquote>You can store many attributes at once by passing a Javascript object to <code>set()</code>.
	If you <em>really</em> want to micro-optimize, you can pass your object to <code>setMany()</code> to avoid the
	overhead of the additional function call and type checking.</blockquote>

<h3><code>update()</code></h3>

<p>Sometimes you only want to set an attribute if it already exists in your Tripod instance. 
	<code>update()</code> will do that for you.</p>

<p>The API for <code>update()</code> is identical to <code>set()</code>, so you can update either a 
	single value using <code>update(attributeName, attributeValue)</code> or many values at once using
	<code>update(object)</code>. There's even an <code>updateMany()</code> that is akin to <code>setMany()</code>.</p>

<blockquote>When <code>update()</code> is passed an object, it iterates through the object's properties and updates
	attributes that already exist. Other properties in the object are discarded.</blockquote>

<h3>But, wait a minute, my data is in the DOM!</h3>

<p>Hang on, we're getting there. I'll give you a hint. You're looking for <code>load()</code>.</p>

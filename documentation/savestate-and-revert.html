title: saveState and revert
---

<p><code>saveState()</code> and <code>revert()</code> allow you to take a snapshot of the 
	state of your object and revert it back to the way it was when you last called <code>saveState()</code>.</p>

<p>The use case that brought this about was pretty simple. What happens if you open up a form in a dialog box, 
	the user makes some changes, then clicks the <em>Cancel</em> button? The user expects the changes they made
	to be canceled, too. (Reverted, actually.)</p>

<h3><code>saveState()</code></h3>

<p>Simply put, the <code>saveState()</code> method makes copy of all the data stored in your Tripod instance and stores it internally.</p>

<p><code>saveState()</code> also returns the copy it made if you'd like to inspect it.</p>

<h3><code>revert()</code></h3>

<p>The <code>revert()</code> method uses the copy created by <code>saveState()</code> to return the Tripod object's data to its previous state.</p>

<p>Tripod is smart enough to only re-set attributes that have changed when you call <code>revert()</code>, which
	saves you a few milliseconds of DOM manipulation time.</p>

title: Data binding and the DOM
---

<p>So far we've just looked at Javascript. If we just lived in the land of Javascript milk and honey,
	we wouldn't need all this fancy data binding goodness. Let's talk about getting your data into and out of the DOM.</p>

<h3>First Things First: Data Attributes</h3>

<p>Tripod needs you to tell it which DOM nodes (inputs, checkboxes, paragraphs, etc) to pay attention to.
	To do that, you need to add a little data attribute to elements you want to sync with your Tripod 
	instance. The attribute is <code>data-bound-to</code> and it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input data-bound-to="vehicle.make"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The examples you see here are namespaced with <code>vehicle</code>. You'll get a quick rundown of namespaces in the next section.</p>

<h3>Pulling Data from the DOM Using <code>instance.load()</code></h3>

<p>In many cases, the data you want is already hanging out in the DOM, but you don't have it available to
	your Javascript yet. For example, when data is loaded into the page on the server side.</p>

<p>Consider this HTML markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input data-bound-to="vehicle.fuel" value="gasoline"&gt;</code></pre>

<p>Snatching this up and adding it to our <code>firstCar</code> instance is trivial:</p>

<pre><code>firstCar.load('fuel');</code></pre>

<p><code>instance.load()</code> works like <code>instance.set()</code> in that the attribute doesn't have to exist
	before you call it. It will be created for you.</p>

<h3><code>instance.load()</code> and LocalStorage</h3>

<p>If you passed <code>true</code> as the third argument in the constructor, your Tripod instance will be backed by LocalStorage.</p>

<blockquote>When your instance is backed by LocalStorage, <code>instance.load()</code> will first check LocalStorage for a value before looking in the DOM.</blockquote>

<h3>Putting Data into the DOM Using <code>instance.push()</code></h3>

<p>Now consider the opposite example. You have your fancy HTML form ready to go, but your data is late to the party.
	Maybe your data is being brought in via an AJAX call.</p>

<p>Have a look at this lovely form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input data-bound-to="vehicle.make"&gt;
&lt;input data-bound-to="vehicle.model"&gt;
&lt;input data-bound-to="vehicle.year"&gt;</code></pre>

<p><code>instance.push()</code> to the rescue!</p>

<pre><code>firstCar.push('make');
firstCar.push('model');
firstCar.push('year');</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you're into the whole brevity thing:</p>

<pre><code>firstCar.push(['make', 'model', 'year']);</code></pre>

<blockquote><em>Protip:</em> <code>instance.load()</code> and <code>instance.push()</code> also accept an array of attributes.</blockquote>

<h3>A Final Note About <code>instance.load()</code> and <code>instance.push()</code></h3>

<p><em>You really only need to use these methods once, if at all.</em> They are designed to perform an initial sync of data
	between the DOM and your Javascript. Once you have data in both places, any edits to the page will automatically show up
	in your Javascript, and any edits to the instance (using <code>instance.set()</code>) are automatically pushed to the DOM.</p>
